            <li><b>September 28,1929</b> September 28, 1929: India was blessed with the Queen of Melody who would enthral the nation with her honey-life voice. The iconic singer was born as Hema Mangeshkar in Indore to Marathi-Konkani musician Deenanath Mangeshkar and his wife Shevanti. She was the eldest among her four siblings - Meena Khadikar, Asha Bhosle, Usha Mangeshkar and Hridaynath Mangeshkar - who are all renowned singers and musicians.</li>

            <li><strong>1935</strong> - "From a young age, the playback singer's father - who adopted the family name Mangeshkar as he was from Goa's native town Mangeshi - started her music training. She began as an actress in Mangeshkar Sr's Marathi musical plays when she was just five years old."</li>

            <li><b>1941</b> - Much before India won its Independence from the British Raj, Mangeshkar started her musical journey at the age of 12. She sang two songs in the studio for the first time for the radio on December 16.</li>

            <li><b>1942</b> - After her father died of a heart condition, movie company Navyug Chitrapat owner Vinayak Damodar Karnataki, who was a close friend of the Mangeshkars, helped bring the then young girl's singing and acting career on track. She got her first break when she acted in Navyug Chitrapat's Marathi movie 'Pahili Mangalaa-gaur', and sang 'Natali Chaitraachi Navalaai' in the movie.</li>
            
            <li><b>2022</b> - India lost her Nightingale. The government declared national mourning for two days with the Tricolour flying at half-mast..</li>
